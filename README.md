# Christchurch Bus Stops
This is a Universal Windows app targeted at mobile devices that is an interface to the Christchurch Metro API. I am building it as part of the training phase of the [Microsoft Student Accelerator](http://www.msa.ms/) programme.

##Description
The Bus Stops app communicates with the Christchurch Metro website at [metroinfo.co.nz](http://www.metroinfo.co.nz/) to bring you information about which buses are due to arrive at a particular platform within the next hour, and their estimated arrival time. You can save your favourite bus stops and label them with names that make sense to you.

##Basic features
* Search for stops by location or by platform number
* Label and organise your favourite stops
* See which buses are coming and when they will arrive

##Possible future features?
* Show/hide certain bus lines
* Integrate with or link to other Metroinfo features (journey planner, schedules, etc.)
* Find bus stops near your location
* Notification when the bus is a few minutes away
